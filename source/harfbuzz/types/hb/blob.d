 * @HB_MEMORY_MODE_DUPLICATE: HarfBuzz immediately makes a copy of the data.
 * @HB_MEMORY_MODE_READONLY: HarfBuzz client will never modify the data,
 *     and HarfBuzz will never modify the data.
 * @HB_MEMORY_MODE_WRITABLE: HarfBuzz client made a copy of the data solely
 *     for HarfBuzz, so HarfBuzz may modify the data.
 * @HB_MEMORY_MODE_READONLY_MAY_MAKE_WRITABLE: See above
 *
 * Data type holding the memory modes available to
 * client programs.
 *
 * Regarding these various memory-modes:
 *
 * - In no case shall the HarfBuzz client modify memory
 *   that is passed to HarfBuzz in a blob.  If there is
 *   any such possibility, @HB_MEMORY_MODE_DUPLICATE should be used
 *   such that HarfBuzz makes a copy immediately,
 *
 * - Use @HB_MEMORY_MODE_READONLY otherwise, unless you really really
 *   really know what you are doing,
 *
 * - @HB_MEMORY_MODE_WRITABLE is appropriate if you really made a
 *   copy of data solely for the purpose of passing to
 *   HarfBuzz and doing that just once (no reuse!),
 *
 * - If the font is mmap()ed, it's okay to use
 *   @HB_MEMORY_MODE_READONLY_MAY_MAKE_WRITABLE, however, using that mode
 *   correctly is very tricky.  Use @HB_MEMORY_MODE_READONLY instead.
